Login shell

       ~/.bash_logout

Interactive shell
       ~/.bashrc

       Bash  attempts  to determine when it is being run with its standard input connected to a network connection, as if by the remote shell
       daemon, usually rshd, or the secure shell daemon sshd.  If bash determines it is being run in this fashion, it reads and  executes  com-
       mands  from  ~/.bashrc,  if  that  file exists and is readable.
