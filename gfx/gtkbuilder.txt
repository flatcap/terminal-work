builder keeps refs to everything
window keeps refs to everything

gtk_builder_get_object DOES NOT addref!

A GtkBuilder is an auxiliary object that reads textual descriptions of a user
interface and instantiates the described objects. To pass a description to a
GtkBuilder, call gtk_builder_add_from_file() or gtk_builder_add_from_string().
These functions can be called multiple times; the builder merges the content of
all descriptions.

A GtkBuilder holds a reference to all objects that it has constructed and drops
these references when it is finalized. This finalization can cause the
destruction of non-widget objects or widgets which are not contained in a
toplevel window. For toplevel windows constructed by a builder, it is the
responsibility of the user to call gtk_widget_destroy() to get rid of them and
all the widgets they contain.

The functions gtk_builder_get_object() and gtk_builder_get_objects() can be
used to access the widgets in the interface by the names assigned to them
inside the UI description. Toplevel windows returned by these functions will
stay around until the user explicitly destroys them with gtk_widget_destroy().
Other widgets will either be part of a larger hierarchy constructed by the
builder (in which case you should not have to worry about their lifecycle), or
without a parent, in which case they have to be added to some container to make
use of them. Non-widget objects need to be reffed with g_object_ref() to keep
them beyond the lifespan of the builder.

The function gtk_builder_connect_signals() and variants thereof can be used to
connect handlers to the named signals in the description.
