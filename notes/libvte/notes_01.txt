VteStream
	reset		calls ftruncate on fd[0], fd[1]
	append		seed to end, write len bytes to fd[0]
	read		check against off[0,1], read from fd[1], then fd[0]
	truncate	ftrunc fd[1], fd[0], swapfds (maybe)
	new_page	? swap fds
	head		= offset[0]
	write_contents

offset of stream is logical start of data - before offset has been lost? sparse?
rolling buffer?  fixed size
swap_fsd: why?

Text stream(n) - just text
Attr stream(16) - ring -> last_attr (16 bytes)	VteCellAttrChange
Row stream(16) - VteRowRecord

Attrs: 0 = default
	256 = default foreground
	257 = default background
	index into palette
		where is the palette defined?

Route from vte_terminal_process_incoming to _vte_ring_freeze_row ?
