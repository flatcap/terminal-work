Escape sequences

Matcher? Trie?
Is is recognised by caps.c?

caps.c
	Maps "Escape seq" to "Seq Name"

vteseq-2.gperf
vteseq-n.gperf
	Lookup "Seq Name" to give a "Seq Handler"

vteseq.c
	"Seq Handler" performs work


Possible outcomes for an escape sequence
	1) It's not in caps.c			echoed to screen
	2) It's commented out of caps.c		echoed to screen
	3) It's not in *.gperf			echoed to screen
	4) It's commented out of *.gperf	echoed to screen
	5) Handler works			handled
