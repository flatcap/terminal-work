create a view 80x24 (V1)
clone it (V2)

resize V1 to 132x24
V2 can
	resize to match
	truncate its output
	add a horizontal scrollbar

if V2 is in a notebook of tabs, it can't resize

need to have a "master" view
start with the first created view
if someone clicks "become master", resize the others to match

master view 80x24
	servant is smaller - truncate lines, follow bottom
	servant is larger  - display all, wrap at size of master
		optionally display margin like screen

if a view has a very long line which is wrapped, then the
cache version needs to have a length which is a multiple of the master width.
if ncurses writes over a wrapped piece of line, it will have space to work in
