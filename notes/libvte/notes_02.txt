How fast is pango layout creation / deletion?
Should we use one layout forever?
Speed of clear / full screen of text?

Ring says:
	Invalidate all
	Some rows invalidated
	Sub row invalidated
	If tracking: Row dead; new row; scroll up
	Rows dead (x, y) - fallen off end!
		View may choose to still display them
